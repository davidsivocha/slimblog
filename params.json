It is a simple, easy to use PHP flat-file blog engine built on top of Slim Framework.\r\n\r\nTo deply simply place it on a webserver in a publicly accessable folder and make sure apache can see the folder.\r\n\r\nFiles need to be uploaded in markdown format, as the document parser reads markdown.\r\n\r\nAll articles need to start with a JSON string at the top that provides the document meta-data and associated title etc. \r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t   \"title\" : \"This is my first article\",\r\n\t   \"date\"  : \"02/15/2012\",\r\n\t   \"slug\"  : \"first-article\",\r\n\t   \"author\": \"Author name\"\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSee the above example there for how to format the JSON correctly. When you save the article, make sure you save it with the same value you place in the slug field in the JSON.\r\n\r\nThe application looks for the route http://yourwebsite/slug which is a handler that points to the articles folder.\r\n\r\nFor example `http://yourwebsite/first-article` will look for `articles/first-article.txt` and then attempt to parse it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in more of my work, head over to my made repository list available on GitHub at [my github profile](http://davidsivocha.github.io) or at my my personal site [Sivocha](http://sivocha.com).\r\n","google":"UA-43986260-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
